## Bundle
### Tailored Hybrid Investments in Government Securities

##### What is a Bundle?

An intelligent hybrid investment with fund diversification in both T-bills and Bonds.

##### Why a Bundle?

NSE in collaboration with RBI has recently made it possible for retail investors to start investing in Government Securities, mainly the long-dated bonds and the treasury bills (T-bills).
The primary motivating factors to create bundle were as follows:
 - Risk Free
 - The common folk is still unaware of the fact.
 - People coming from a background of investing in FDs might find T-bills and Govt Bonds complex.
 - No tool to intelligently allocate funds between the two components to maximise returns.
